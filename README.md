Hi guys!
This is my first tool for jailbroken devices,
it's open source so you can help me to improve it and make it better and better.

## How it works?
The first time you open the app you have to type in your root password in order to make it works.  
> default password is alpine

After that, the app will save it so you don't have to re-enter it every time you want to do something.
The app works by NMSSH, an Objective-C Library that enables an SSH instance that login as root and executes the command based on the pressed button.

## Features:

 - Respring
 - Reboot
 - LDRestart
 - Safe Mode
 - Shutdown
 - UICache

## Extras:

 - 3D Touch Quick Actions
 - Shake to Respring
